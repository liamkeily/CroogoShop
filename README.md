# Croogo Shop 

## In Development

This is a shop plugin for Croogo that is currently in development.

The plugin will integrate itself nicley into croogo and allow other plugins to extend it.

The current plan is have product as a content type for nodes, this way plugins for nodes such as NodeImages can also be used for products. It also means that we can easily use taxonomy for products aswell.

CroogoPayments will be a seperate plugin that CroogoShop will use for processing order payments. CroogoPayments should also be usable elsewhere in croogo and by other plugins. 

## Progress

This plugin is currently not ready for use.

## Installation

Clone into Plugin directory and enable through Extensions > Plugin
