# Croogo Shop 

## In Development

This is a shop plugin for Croogo that is currently in development.

The plugin will integrate itself nicley into croogo and be extendible by other pugins.

The current plan is have product as a new Node Content Type, this will allow us to take advantage of lots of functionality including:

- Taxonomy
- Plugins Built for Nodes

CroogoPayments will be a seperate plugin that CroogoShop will use for processing order payments. CroogoPayments should also be usable elsewhere in croogo and by other plugins. 

## Compatability

This plugin is being developed for 2.0 (may be compatible with previous versions)

## Progress

This plugin is currently not ready for use.

## Installation

From console run ./Console/cake schema create --plugin CroogoShop

Clone into Plugin directory and enable through Extensions > Plugin
